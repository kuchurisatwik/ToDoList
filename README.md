# 📝 ToDoList (FastAPI) — Beginner Practice Project

Hi! 👋  
This is a **small To-Do backend** that I created using **FastAPI** while practicing.  
I’m still a **beginner** (only done about 2 FastAPI projects so far), so I tried to write everything in a clean and simple way so that other beginners can also understand.

---

## 💡 What this project is

- A simple backend where you can **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** To-Do tasks.
- It also has **user authentication** (login) just to practice how auth works in FastAPI.
- Mainly made for **learning** and **understanding project structure** (routers, models, schemas, DB, auth, etc).

---

## 🧠 Why I built it

I wanted to understand:
- How FastAPI apps are **structured** (like where to put routes, models, schemas etc.)
- How to connect **SQLAlchemy** with FastAPI
- How to implement **JWT authentication** and **hash passwords**
- How to use **Swagger UI** to test endpoints
